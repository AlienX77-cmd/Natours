### What I have learned

- Advanced usage of MongoDB and Mongoose and the RESTFUL API developement: This includes the usage of query strings and the development of query middleware and how to work with the request body. Building advanced data models that use child and parent referencing between them.

- Learning on how to use virtual population where you are able to fetch referenced documents that are not persisted in the database and display them in the query result. An example of this is how each individual tour can have many reviews and the reviews have their own model. Rather than creating a reference that persists in the DB, which could contain thousands of items, we can connect them through a virtual populate.

- Complex and Advanced Error Handling: here, I learned to separate the operational and programming errors. In this approach, you can send useful messages to the user if something goes wrong with user error and keep the programming errors for the developers to see only. Below is a flow chart (Credit: J.D. Browne) that helps illustrates the error handling functions.
